# **Store-locator**

application that shows the 5 closest stores to a given position.

## **Requirements**

Create an application that shows the 5 closest Jumbo stores to a given position.
You can find a list of Jumbo stores in JSON format attached to this document.

There are just a few rules:

* it has to be a Java application. What frameworks, libraries you use etc is up to you.
* It has to be a web application. We would like to see at least an API, having an HTML/Javascript frontend is a nice to have.
* Write your code as if itâ€™s production code as much as possible.
* Make sure the reviewer can easily run the application for evaluation purposes.
