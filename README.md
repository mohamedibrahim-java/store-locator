There are just a few rules:

* it has to be a Java application.What frameworks,libraries you use etc is up to you.
* It has to be a web application.We would like to see at least an API,having an HTML/Javascript frontend is a nice to have.
* Write your code as if itâ€™s production code as much as possible.
* Make sure the reviewer can easily run the application for evaluation purposes.
